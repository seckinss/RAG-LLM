Its introduction to Europe began\nin 1782 when a French Jesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot,\nacquired a copy of it, and translated it into French. It was not a good\ntranslation because, according to Dr. Giles, \"[I]t contains a great\ndeal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and very little indeed of what he\ndid.\"",

Omissions were frequent; hard passages were\nwillfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic,\nand a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in\ntranslations from Chinese.\" In 1908 a new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s\ntranslation was published in London. It was an improvement on the\nfirst—omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected—but new\nerrors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his\ntranslation, wrote: \"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate\nof my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a",

May I submit your theory of\nmanaging soldiers to a slight test?\"\n\nSun Tzŭ replied: \"You may.\"\n\nHo Lu asked: \"May the test be applied to women?\"\n\nThe answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to\nbring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzŭ divided them into two\ncompanies, and placed one of the King’s favourite concubines at the head\nof each.

When I\nsay \"About turn,\" you must face right round towards your back.\"\n\nAgain the girls assented. The words of command having been thus\nexplained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin the\ndrill.

But if his orders _are_\nclear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of\ntheir officers.\"\n\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\npavilion; and when he saw that his favourite concubines were about to be\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\nmessage: \"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to\nhandle troops.

On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well\nhave seen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period\n482-473, when Yüeh was once again becoming a very serious menace.

How to make the best of both strong and weak—that is a question\ninvolving the proper use of ground.\n\n[Mei Yao-ch’en’s paraphrase is: \"The way to eliminate the differences\nof strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize\naccidental features of the ground.\" Less reliable troops, if posted in\nstrong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more\nexposed terrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority\nin stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: \"With all respect to the\ntext books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to\nthink that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no\nmeans sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions…\nand to the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are\ndefending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural\nfeatures.\" [2] ]\n\n\n34.
